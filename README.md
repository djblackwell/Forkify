# Forkify
Recipes app

App built on first JavaScript course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

Designed to retrieve recipes and ingredients from an API which the course mentor has now implemented to mimic the original API Food2fork as they are no more.

App completed at base level with a tonne of additonal functionality and styling to be added and etra course additions too!

Good fun to build as a first app and exposes a lot of different methods and functions along with npm packages and how to use it all together.

More to Come!
